      <span><b>Thank you — the collaboration has been approved ✅</b></span>
      You are now officially a <b>collaborator</b> with the Data User.
      They plan to use your dataset in their research and have already begun shaping how it will be used in an upcoming publication.
      📚 Preparing a scientific article is a complex and time-consuming process.
      The Data User may reach out to you by email — to ask questions, request clarification, or simply keep you informed about progress.
      We encourage you to stay open to communication and offer support when possible.
      📝 Under the terms of the agreement, your main responsibility as a
      Data Author is to <b>review the final draft</b> of the manuscript to ensure the correctness of the data analysis and the text as a whole.
      ⏳ You will have <b>30 days</b> to do this, starting from the date the final draft is submitted to you.
      However, you are welcome to coordinate with the Data User and agree on a shorter review period or a more convenient format if needed.
      <span>📎 <b>Attached</b> you will find the Collaboration Agreement, signed by both parties.</span>
